# langchain_experiments
Repository with some codes to get familar with Langchain


Ideas/next steps :

knowledge graph in Neo4j that links papers together and ask questions about it 

ollama local distant ? put it in my Docker image or link 2 images together in the same container (COMPOSE in Docker) (same for faiss test whether local or distant)

UI with streamlit

speed computations : ssh to Polytechnique computers (or Harvard ones?), of course need to install ollama on these computers (Polytechnique's are on Linux)
