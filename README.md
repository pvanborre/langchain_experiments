# langchain_experiments
Repository with some codes to get familar with Langchain


Ideas/next steps :

knowledge graph in Neo4j that links papers together and ask questions about it 

ollama local distant ? put it in my Docker image or link 2 images together in the same container (same for faiss test whether local or distant)

UI with streamlit

speed computations : ssh to Polytechnique computers (or Harvard ones?)

reproductible environment : test Onyxia (i never used it, it could be a good usecase)
