       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\r\\nPublic messaging in the US during the coronavirus pandemic has diverged sharply along partisan\\r\\nlines. President Trump and other Republican officials have sometimes downplayed the severity of\\r\\nthe crisis, while Democratic leaders have given more emphasis to its dangers (Beauchamp 2020;\\r\\nStanley-Becker and Janes 2020; Coppins 2020; McCarthy 2020). Similar divisions appear in\\r\\npartisan media (Aleem 2020; Kantrowitz 2020).\\r\\nNationwide surveys mirror the partisan divisions in elite messaging—with Democrats reporting\\r\\nmore concern about COVID-19 and higher levels of social distancing than Republicans (see Figure\\r\\n1). However, Democratic areas have also had more coronavirus cases and implemented stay-at\\x02home policies earlier. The raw differences observed on surveys could simply be the expected result\\r\\nof local differences in risk or regulation. Furthermore, prior evidence shows that apparent partisan\\r\\ngaps in beliefs can shrink substantially when there are moderate incentives for accuracy (Bullock\\r\\net al. 2015; Prior et al. 2015). Beliefs about the number of casualties in Iraq or the presidential\\r\\napproval rating have, for most people, few direct consequences. Beliefs about the severity of the\\r\\npandemic and choosing whether to social distance, on the other hand, may be a matter of life or\\r\\ndeath. We ask whether partisan gaps persist in the face of these large incentives.\\r\\nIn this paper, we combine GPS location data from a large sample of smartphones with a new\\r\\nsurvey to study partisan differences in the response to COVID-19. The GPS data are collected by\\r\\nthe company SafeGraph, and record daily and weekly visits to points of interest (POIs), including\\r\\nrestaurants, hotels, hospitals, and many other public and private businesses. Our primary analysis\\r\\nfocuses on the period from January 27, 2020 to July 12, 2020.\\r\\nWe present a simple model that clarifies the potential causes and consequences of divergent\\r\\nsocial-distancing behavior. It combines a standard epidemiological model of a pandemic with\\r\\nan economic model of optimizing behavior by heterogeneous agents. The model clarifies that\\r\\ndivergent responses between groups need not be inefficient. One group might engage in less social\\r\\ndistancing because their costs of distancing are greater (e.g., they would lose more income) or\\r\\nbecause their benefits of distancing are smaller (e.g., they are at lower risk of infection). However,\\r\\ndifferences in behavior resulting from divergent beliefs of otherwise similar agents do suggest\\r\\nsystematic inefficiency, as optimizing based on different beliefs means that the marginal costs of\\r\\nsocial distancing are not equated across people. Achieving a given level of social distancing in\\r\\nsociety will be more costly when otherwise similar agents have heterogeneous beliefs.\\r\\n2\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Our main GPS results show that the strong partisan differences in social distancing behavior\\r\\nthat emerged with the rise of COVID-19 are not merely an artifact of differences in public policies\\r\\nor observed risks. Controlling for state-time fixed effects to account for heterogenous policy re\\x02sponses by state governments only attenuates the partisan gap slightly. Including controls to proxy\\r\\nfor local policy, health, weather, and economic variables interacted flexibly with time attenuates\\r\\nthe gap more substantially, but it remains statistically and economically significant. After including\\r\\nour full set of controls, we estimate that moving from the 10th to the 90th percentile of Republican\\r\\ncounty vote share is associated with 11.5 and 15.2 percent increases in the number of POI visits\\r\\nduring the weeks of April 6 and May 11, when social distancing and partisan gaps are at their\\r\\nrespective peaks.\\r\\nOur findings are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of control variables, excluding states with\\r\\nearly COVID-19 outbreaks, or dropping highly populated counties. Replacing the continuous mea\\x02sure of partisanship with discrete indicators for portions of the Republican vote share distribution\\r\\nor restricting the sample to counties from certain portions of the distribution does not change our\\r\\nqualitative conclusions. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a similar partisan gap during the\\r\\nsame period in 2019 conditional on the same set of controls. We find similar evidence of a partisan\\r\\ngap at the voting precinct level, but focus on county-level analyses due to limitations facing the\\r\\nprecinct specification (see footnote 14).\\r\\nTo complement the data showing county-level differences in behavior, we use a nationally\\x02representative survey to show that individual behavior and beliefs about social distancing are par\\x02tisan. We collect participants’ demographics (including party affiliation), beliefs regarding the\\r\\nefficacy of social distancing, self-reported distancing due to COVID-19, and predictions about fu\\x02ture COVID-19 cases. Compared to Republicans, we find that Democrats believe the pandemic is\\r\\nmore severe and report a greater reduction in contact with others. In our survey, we also randomly\\r\\nvary whether predictions about future COVID-19 cases are incentivized. We do not find evidence\\r\\nthat incentives reduce the partisan gap, suggesting that these predictions are less likely to be due\\r\\nto partisan cheerleading (as in Bullock et al. 2015 and Prior et al. 2015) and more likely to reflect\\r\\ntrue differences in beliefs.

Fan et al. (2020)\\r\\nfind differences in risk perceptions and social distancing in GPS and survey data across political\\r\\nparties and other demographics. Our results are broadly consistent with these other studies, but\\r\\nwe believe that our paper contributes to the discussion through a unique combination of obser\\x02vational data analysis, survey work, and a theoretical model that helps understand the economic\\r\\nimplications of our results.\\r\\nAsh et al.

Mobilizing an effective public\\r\\nresponse to an emerging pandemic requires clear communication and trust (Holmes 2008; Taylor\\r\\net al. 2009; van der Weerd et al. 2011; Vaughan and Tinker 2009). Risk perception, behavior\\r\\nchanges, and trust in government information sources change as pandemics progress (Ibuka et al.\\r\\n2010; Bults et al. 2011). Demographic characteristics, such as gender, income, geography, or\\r\\nsocial interactions, are important determinants of the adoption of recommended public health be\\x02haviors (Bish and Michie 2010; Ibuka et al. 2010; Bults et al. 2011; Chuang et al. 2015; Shultz et\\r\\nal. 2016; Gamma et al. 2017).\\r\\nA related literature focuses on the consequences of political polarization for health behaviors\\r\\n(e.g., Iyengar et al. 2019 and Montoya-Williams and Fuentes-Afflick 2019). Party affiliation is\\r\\ncorrelated with physician recommendations on politicized health procedures, enrollment in gov\\x02ernment exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, beliefs in the safety of vaccines, and\\r\\nhurricane evacuations (Hersh and Goldenberg 2016; Lerman et al. 2017; Sances and Clinton 2019;\\r\\ncontrols for differential risk exposure or costs of social distancing (e.g., Economist 2020; Andersen 2020). Baker et\\r\\nal. (forthcoming) use transaction-level data and examine heterogeneity in consumption responses to COVID-19.\\r\\n2Pastor and Veronesi (forthcoming) also find that Democrats are more risk averse than Republicans. Differences in\\r\\nrisk aversion would not explain the differences in beliefs we find in Section 5, but are a possible complementary\\r\\nexplanation for the observed partisan gap in social distancing.\\r\\n4\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

We embed an epidemiological model of disease\\r\\ntransmission into an economic model with agents who maximize utility considering the expected\\r\\nprivate cost of disease. We consider how heterogeneity in perceived risks affects aggregate welfare.\\r\\n2.1 Epidemiological Model\\r\\nWe use a discrete-time version of the standard SIR epidemiological model (Kermack and McK\\x02endrick 1927). In each period t, each person is in one of four states σ ∈ {S,I,R,D}, representing\\r\\nSusceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased. The share of the population in each state at time t\\r\\nis st, it, rt, and dt. Let β represent disease infectiousness, and let ct denote an individual’s amount\\r\\nof risky behavior at time t—for example, the amount of travel, dining out, failing to wash hands,\\r\\nand other activities that increase the risk of becoming Infected.\\r\\nAll people begin in the Susceptible state. A Susceptible person becomes Infected at time t +1\\r\\nwith probability ctβit and stays Susceptible with probability (1 − ctβit). Infected people stay\\r\\nInfected for one period, after which they become Deceased with probability ψ or Recovered with\\r\\nprobability (1−ψ). Both D and R are absorbing states.\\r\\nLet θ index different types of people—for example, liberals and conservatives. Let ωθσt be\\r\\na state variable representing the share of type θ that is in state σ at time t. The population is of\\r\\nmeasure 1, so ∑θ ∑σ ωθσt = 1.\\r\\n2.2 Individual Decisions\\r\\nPeople of type θ earn flow utility uθ (ct;σt), which depends on their risky behavior ct and their state\\r\\nσt. People discount the future at rate δ and maximize expected lifetime utility ∑\\r\\n∞\\r\\nτ=t\\r\\nδ\\r\\nτuθ (cτ ;στ ).\\r\\n5\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

(2)\\r\\nThe first-order condition shows that people choose their risky behavior to equate marginal ben\\x02efit (more utility today) with private marginal cost (higher risk of infection, which reduces future\\r\\nutility). The equation illustrates that there are three reasons why risky behavior might vary across\\r\\ntypes. First is the marginal utility of risk (or equivalently, the marginal cost of social distancing):\\r\\nfor example, people vary in how much they like travel and dining out, as well as in how easy it is\\r\\nto work from home. Second is the marginal infection probability: for example, local infection rate\\r\\nit differs across geographic areas. Third is the private cost of infection: for example, infection is\\r\\nmore harmful for people who are older or have underlying health conditions.\\r\\n2.3 Social Optimum\\r\\nIt is difficult to know for sure whether people take too many or too few steps to reduce disease\\r\\ntransmission during our study period. Thus, we do not consider the optimal consumption of c.\\r\\nInstead, we hold constant the total amount of risky behavior and ask whether the allocation across\\r\\ntypes is optimal. Tangibly, this means that we are not asking, “how much social distancing should\\r\\npeople be doing?” Instead, we are asking, “holding constant the amount of social distancing people\\r\\nare doing, would some people ideally be doing less, and others ideally be doing more?”\\r\\nSocial welfare is the sum of utility across all people in all states:\\r\\n6\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

First, it imposes a positive pecuniary ex\\x02ternality, as travel, dining out, and other risky activities help keep firms in business and workers\\r\\nemployed. Second, it imposes a negative externality by increasing the person’s infection prob\\x02ability, which increases the expected stock of infected people in the next period (it+1) and then\\r\\nincreases other Susceptible people’s infection risk. Let φt denote the net externality per unit of\\r\\nconsumption, which may be positive or negative; this becomes more negative as the contagion\\r\\nexternality grows.

Appendix Figure A2 shows that these strong partisan differences do\\r\\nnot appear over the same time period in 2019 conditional on the same controls. These results are\\r\\nconsistent with behavioral differences driven by partisan misperceptions of risks at the group-level.\\r\\nTo better understand the magnitudes of this partisan gap, we compare the difference between\\r\\nvery Republican and very Democratic counties to contemporaneous mobility levels and to overall\\r\\nsocial distancing relative to January. The estimate of our partisan gap coefficient αtis 0.292 by the\\r\\nweek starting April 6 (the week with the fewest number of visits) and 0.386 in the week starting\\r\\nMay 11 (the week with the largest partisan gap). These estimates imply that going from a county\\r\\nwith the 10th to the 90th percentile in Republican vote share is associated with 11.5 and 15.2\\r\\npercent increases in the number of POI visits during these two weeks respectively.12 The 11.5\\r\\npercent gap during the week of April 6 corresponds to 6.5 percent of the total change in POI\\r\\nvisits between the weeks of January 27 and April 6, and the partisan gap during the week of May\\r\\n11 is comparable in size to 15.0 percent of the total change in POI visits between the weeks of\\r\\nJanuary 27 and May 11.13 The partisan gap in social distancing between very Republican and very\\r\\nDemocratic counties is economically meaningful but only accounts for a limited portion of overall\\r\\nsocial distancing.\\r\\nIn Appendix Figure A3, we report sensitivity to various alternative specifications.

Again, these patterns\\r\\nare not present in 2019 (Appendix Figure A5). Precinct-level analysis faces several limitations that\\r\\nlead us to prefer our county-level specification.14\\r\\nAppendix Figure A6 examines heterogeneity across industries by aggregating POI visits to the\\r\\ncounty level after restricting to certain 2-digit NAICS codes. Consistent with the narrative around\\r\\nCOVID-19, we see the strongest partisan differences emerge with POIs in the accommodations\\r\\nand food, entertainment, and retail industries. The partisan differences in visits to health care POIs\\r\\nare generally smaller and are statistically significant in fewer weeks.\\r\\nAppendix Figure A7 repeats Panel C of Figure 4, but uses POI visits aggregated at the day level.\\r\\nThe partisan differences emerge for both weekdays and weekends, suggesting these differences are\\r\\nnot driven solely by differences in work-from-home policies.\\r\\nAppendix Figure A8 considers alternative measures of social distancing derived from Safe\\x02Graph’s Social Distancing data. Statistically significant partisan differences emerge in March\\r\\nthrough at least early July for the log number of devices leaving home, the log number of stops\\r\\nmade in non-home census block groups, the log of the median time away from home (Panel A),\\r\\nand the share of devices leaving home (Panel B).15 In Panel C, we conduct our alternative social\\r\\ndistancing analysis at the precinct level while including county-time fixed effects. For the log num\\x02ber of devices leaving home and the log number of stops made in non-home census block groups,\\r\\nwe find an economically and statistically significant partisan gap emerge starting in April and per\\x02sisting through early July (though see footnote 14 for limitations of the precinct-level analysis).\\r\\n14We note several limitations of our precinct-level analysis. Due to the limited availability of 2016 precinct-level\\r\\nshapefiles, our precinct-level analysis includes only 42 states (see Appendix A.1.2). Partisanship is measured at the\\r\\nprecinct-level, while social distancing and our health, weather, and economic controls are generally measured at\\r\\nthe census block group level. The latter set of variables are then mapped to precincts based on geographic overlap\\r\\nusing the procedure described in Appendix A.1.2, potentially introducing correlated measurement error between\\r\\nour outcome and non-partisanship controls. Finally, POI visits are allocated to geographies by merchant location\\r\\nwhereas partisanship is measured among residents. With smaller geographies, it becomes increasingly likely that\\r\\nvisitors to a POI come from a different home geography, resulting in mismatch between visits and partisanship.\\r\\n15A key issue with the SafeGraph social distancing data is sample attrition. SafeGraph restricts the panel to devices\\r\\nwith observed location pings in a given time period. For some applications, the frequency of location pings depends\\r\\non device mobility. If devices are immobile at home or turned off, they may not generate location pings and would\\r\\nthen be dropped from the sample. The total number of active devices changes over our sample period in a manner\\r\\nconsistent with sample attrition. Given these issues, we prefer measures of social distancing derived solely from\\r\\nexternal activity (e.g., POI visits) that do not contain the same measurement error problems. We attempt to correct\\r\\nfor the differential attrition in our measure of the share of devices leaving home (see Appendix Figure A8 footnotes\\r\\nfor correction).\\r\\n14\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5 Survey Results\\r\\nTurning to the results of our survey, we first confirm that individuals’ beliefs related to COVID-19\\r\\nare strongly associated with their social distancing behaviors. We find that a one standard deviation\\r\\n(SD) increase in beliefs about the efficacy of social distancing, as described below, is associated\\r\\nwith a 0.323 SD increase in self-reported social distancing (SE 0.022; p < 0.001), controlling for\\r\\ndemographic characteristics and state fixed effects. Similarly, a one SD increase in beliefs about\\r\\nthe number of future cases in the US is associated with a 0.066 SD increase in self-reported social\\r\\ndistancing (SE 0.023; p = 0.004).\\r\\nNext, we show that there exist individual-level partisan differences in (self-reported) social dis\\x02tancing behaviors and attitudes, consistent with the GPS analysis presented above. We then show\\r\\nthat beliefs about the effectiveness of social distancing and predictions of the spread of COVID-19\\r\\nfollow the same partisan patterns. Our main empirical specification regresses normalized responses\\r\\non party:\\r\\nyi = κ +αρi +γXi +εi,\\r\\nwhere yiis the number of standard deviations above the mean for response i, ρiis the continuous\\r\\nmeasure of Republican party lean from 0 to 1, Xi are demographic and location controls, and εiis\\r\\nan error term.\\r\\nFigure 5 shows consistent evidence for partisan differences in social distancing, both with and\\r\\nwithout control variables.16 On average, participants report reducing contact by 70.0 percent, with\\r\\na SD of 24.5 percent. After including controls, strong Democrats report engaging in 0.18 SD more\\r\\ncontact reduction than strong Republicans. This corresponds to a gap in contact reduction of 72.1\\r\\npercent for strong Democrats versus 67.8 percent for strong Republicans. Similarly, Democrats\\r\\nfind it significantly more important to stay inside to prevent the spread of the virus versus go\\r\\noutside to help the economy, and the difference between strong partisans is 0.23 SD.\\r\\nWe then examine the partisan differences in underlying beliefs regarding COVID-19 severity\\r\\nand efficacy of social distancing. We find that Democrats’ belief regarding the probability of\\r\\ncatching COVID-19 without any social distancing is higher than the analogous belief held by\\r\\nRepublicans. On average, participants assess this probability to be 55.0 percent (SD 31.9 percent).\\r\\n16These differences are also present when we do not weight observations for national representativeness, as shown in\\r\\nAppendix Figure A9.

When we randomize whether subjects’ predictions are incentivized\\r\\nfor accuracy, we do not find evidence that the partisan gap decreases.19 This supports the view\\r\\nthat Democrats and Republicans genuinely differ in their beliefs about the severity of COVID-19.\\r\\nAppendix Figure A10 shows that on an explicitly political question, incentives do significantly\\r\\nreduce the partisan gap, consistent with previous findings.\\r\\nAppendix Figure A11 shows that comparing individuals within the same county produces qual\\x02itatively similar results, complementing the county-level partisan gap observed in the GPS analysis.\\r\\nHowever, since 21.5 percent of participants are the only participant from their county, statistical\\r\\nprecision is lower and low-population counties are underweighted.\\r\\nFinally, we do a back-of-the-envelope estimation of the deadweight loss from equation (8).\\r\\nWe assume that agents have the same quadratic flow utility functions u(c) = ν\\r\\n2\\r\\nc\\r\\n2 + ηc + k and\\r\\nnormalize parameters so that c\\r\\n∗ = 1 is the amount of risky behavior chosen in the absence of\\r\\nthe coronavirus. (Formally, if β = 0, all agents choose c\\r\\n∗\\r\\n(0) = 1, i.e., ν = −η ≤ 0.) We then\\r\\nconsider what happens when partisan perceptions differ about infectiousness β. From our survey,\\r\\nwe find that the median participant’s willingness-to-accept for “cutting off all in-person contact\\r\\nwith people outside your household for one month” versus “following your normal routine” (i.e.,\\r\\none month of c = 0 instead of c = 1) is $1500. From the survey data above, we approximate that\\r\\nDemocrats reduce consumption by 72.1 percent and Republicans reduce by 67.8 percent. This\\r\\ndifference implies that, after controlling for observables that measure private costs and benefits of\\r\\nsocial distancing, Democrats perceive that the expected utility loss from following normal routines\\r\\n17These averages are calculated after winsorizing at the 5-percent level to account for outliers.\\r\\n18The actual number of confirmed April COVID cases was 901,670 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/).\\r\\nSubjects’ underprediction might be due to misunderstanding of exponential growth, generic overoptimism, anchor\\x02ing (177,226 was given as the reference number for cases by March 31), or to some other factor.\\r\\n19The gap slightly increases, though the effect is statistically insignificant.

We begin by matching SafeGraph POIs to the counties in which they are located. We use\\r\\nlatitude and longitude from SafeGraph’s July 2020 Core POI dataset, along with the 2010\\r\\nTIGER county shapefile.21 We successfully assign 99.9 percent of the POIs to a county.\\r\\n2. We then merge the POI-county mapping from (1) onto SafeGraph’s Patterns data using the\\r\\nsafegraph-place-id variable. We sum visits by county for a given day, aggregating across\\r\\nPOIs.\\r\\n3. We then merge alternative county-day measures of social distancing onto the output from\\r\\n(2). These measures are constructed as follows from the Daily Social Distancing SafeGraph\\r\\ndata with observations at the census block group-day level for January 27 through July 12.\\r\\nWe exclude Alaska. We restrict our sample to census block groups with active devices\\r\\nthroughout the entire time period. We also drop one census block group with anomalous\\r\\nbehavior as notified by SafeGraph (FIPS: 190570010001). We aggregate this series to the\\r\\ncounty level. Countable variables (e.g., ‘device count’) are summed, while we take a ‘device\\r\\ncount’ weighted average of other variables (e.g., ‘median home dwell time’).\\r\\n4. We then merge gridMET weather data onto the output from (3). Precipitation and tempera\\x02ture means for a given county day are taken as a mean across grid cell points that lie within\\r\\na county boundary. Weather data was not available for Hawaii, so this particular state is\\r\\ndropped in regressions including weather controls.\\r\\n5. We then merge The New York Times COVID-19 tracking data onto our output from (4). We\\r\\nassume zero cases and deaths for the observations not observed in The New York Times data.\\r\\nWe drop the five counties associated with New York City and the four counties which overlap\\r\\nwith Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times lists these as geographic exceptions\\r\\nwhere it either does not assign cases to these counties or excludes cases occurring within the\\r\\ncity.\\r\\n21Downloaded from https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf counties.html on July 24, 2018.\\r\\n28\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

This dataset of shelter-in-place orders is the same as in Allcott\\r\\net al. (2020), where its construction is described in detail. It is ultimately sourced from\\r\\nKeystone Strategy, a crowdsourcing effort from Stanford University and the University of\\r\\nVirginia, Hikma Health, and The New York Times.\\r\\n7. We then aggregate the output from (6) to the county-week level using sums, averages, or\\r\\nstart- or end-of-week observations as appropriate.\\r\\n8. We then merge onto the output from (7) a dataset of county-level demographic information\\r\\nconstructed as follows. We use the Open Census data from SafeGraph, aggregating up the\\r\\ndata given at the census block group level to the county level. We combine this with data on\\r\\ncounty 2016 Presidential votes shares (MIT Election Data and Science Lab 2018). We define\\r\\nthe Republican vote share to be the share of votes received by the Republican candidate over\\r\\nthe sum of votes across all candidates. We exclude counties without valid vote data, which\\r\\ndrops Alaska and two additional counties (FIPS: 15005, 51515).\\r\\nA.1.2 Precinct-Level Data Build\\r\\n1.

Of these POIs, we successfully match 99.6 percent to a unique\\r\\nprecinct in the states covered by these precinct shapefiles and drop the 0.001 percent matched\\r\\nto two precincts. The precinct shapefiles cover the following 42 states: AK, AR, AZ, CA,\\r\\nCO, DC, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MT, NC,\\r\\nND, NE, NH, NM, NV, OK, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, and WY.\\r\\n2.

Weather data by precinct\\r\\nday was constructed as a land area weighted average of weather data for overlapping census\\r\\nblock groups. Census block group centroids were first associated with the nearest grid cell\\r\\ncentroid in gridMET. Weather data was not available for Hawaii, so this particular state is\\r\\ndropped in regressions including weather controls.\\r\\n5. We then merge The New York Times COVID-19 county-level tracking data onto our output\\r\\nfrom (4). Precincts were first associated with the county corresponding to the census block\\r\\ngroup of their largest intersection. We drop the five counties associated with New York City\\r\\nand the four counties which overlap with Kansas City (MO), because The New York Times\\r\\nlists these as geographic exceptions where it either does not assign cases to these counties or\\r\\nexcludes cases occurring within the city.\\r\\n6. We then merge the dataset of county-level shelter-in-place order start dates from (6) in Sec\\x02tion A.1.1 onto the output from (5). We construct an indicator for whether a county had been\\r\\nsubject to a shelter-in-place order by a given date.\\r\\n7. We then aggregate the output from (6) to the precinct-week level using sums, averages, or\\r\\nstart- or end-of-week observations as appropriate.\\r\\n8. We then merge onto the output from (7) a dataset of precinct-level demographic information\\r\\nconstructed as follows. We start with the Open Census census block group level demograph\\x02ics from (8) in Section A.1.1. We then aggregate countable variables to the precinct-level\\r\\nusing the intersection share procedure described in (3). We then form ratios (e.g., ‘population\\r\\ndensity’ or ‘share hispanic’) using these summed precinct-level estimates. We then merge\\r\\nprecinct-level 2016 Presidential votes shares (Voting and Election Science Team 2018) onto\\r\\nthe resulting output, constructed as in A.1.1 step (8). We drop Alaska in order to be consis\\x02tent with our county construction.\\r\\nA.2 Survey Details\\r\\nA.2.1 Data\\r\\nWe clean the survey data from Qualtrics as follows:\\r\\n23This estimate is exactly correct if a given demographic xb is evenly distributed across a census block group’s area.\\r\\n30\\n', metadata={'source': 'allcott.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",

The specifications are\\r\\nanalogous to our baseline in Panel C of Figure 4 or Panel D of Figure A4 for county- and precinct-level regressions respectively, except that we\\r\\nreplace log visits with the following alternative outcomes:\\r\\n• Panel A: ‘Log Devices Leaving Home’ is the log of one plus the number of active devices in the panel minus the active devices never\\r\\nobserved leaving their geohash-7 home. ‘Log Stops in Non-Home CBGs’ counts, by home county, the number of devices which stop in\\r\\na given non-home census block group. We then sum across non-home census block groups and days to form our county-week outcome.\\r\\n‘Log Median Time Away from Home’ calculates the median time a device is observed outside its geohash-7 home, by home census block\\r\\ngroup. We then take a device-weighted average across census block groups and days to form our county-week measure, and then take the\\r\\nlog of this value.\\r\\n• Panel B: This panel shows the share of devices which are observed outside their geohash-7 home, making different assumptions about\\r\\nattrition observed in the data. ‘Share of Devices’ is defined to be 1 −\\r\\nhome devices\\r\\ncurrent device count , where ‘home devices’ are active devices never\\r\\nobserved leaving their geohash-7 home and ‘current device count’ is the number of active devices for the current week. ‘Share of Candidate\\r\\nDevices’ is similarly defined as 1 −\\r\\nhome devices\\r\\ncandidate device count , where ‘candidate device count’ is the number of devices regardless of activity.\\r\\n‘Share Adjusted for Attrition’ is defined to be 1−\\r\\nmax{0,home devices+(initital device count−current device count)}\\r\\ninitial device count , where ‘initial device count’ is the\\r\\nnumber of active devices for the week of February 1.\\r\\n• Panel C: This panel produces precinct-level analogues of the first two plots in Panel A. Our specification matches Panel D of Figure A4\\r\\n(including county-time fixed effects), and we map our original census block group-level social distancing measures to precincts using the\\r\\nmethod described in Section A.1.2.
